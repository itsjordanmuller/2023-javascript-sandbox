<h4>Looking for Live Demos? 🌐</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you're eager to simply see the results of this project, most, if not all of the projects have a Live Demo associated with them. I have linked them all in the overview for each specific project/section. To view these live demos, simply follow the links provided with each project. You'll see them alongside buttons that look like this:</p>

  <p>Click the button/link and you should be taken to the Live Demo for that specific project. Please note that some projects don't have a Live Demo, and if that's the case there will not be a button/link. I'm hoping to get all of the projects on the internet at some point in the near future, so check back soon and you might find a link!</p>

<h4>Want to View the Projects on Your Local Machine? 💻</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>I have provided detailed instructions for how to clone/download this repository to your local machine in the Setup Instructions section. In that section, you should find everything you need to be able to get these projects running and working on your own machine. Please note that a few of the projects use external APIs that include verification, so you will need to setup your own accounts/API keys for those services.</p>
  <p>If you plan on running the code on your local machine, be sure to check the specific project you're trying to run to see if it needs any additional information or setup for the connections to the API to work. In most cases, I will try to include a `.env.example` file. You will need to open this file, and read the instructions inside to obtain your own API key. Once that's done, you'll need to make sure you've renamed the file from `.env.example` to `.env` only.</p>
  <p>If you want to avoid setting up environment variables, check to see if the project has a Live Demo associated with it. For all of the projects that I have hosted on the internet, you'll be able to use them without any API configuration required. This is often a simpler way of viewing more complicated projects, since everything will already be running for you to view, use & explore.</p>

To be able to clone/download & view these projects, or to start learning <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong>, and <strong>JavaScript</strong> as well as web development in general, you'll need a few essential tools. At a minimum, you should have a basic text editor/integrated development environment, a web browser, and an internet connection.

I used the following:

- **Text Editor/IDE:** I use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as my main integrated development environment. VS Code can be customized to work with just about any technology, making it a great choice for a general all-purpose IDE, it also has a large and helpful community for support.
- **Web Browser:** I prefer to use [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) for their comprehensive set of [Chrome DevTools](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/). While most if not all of the tools are available in other browsers/Developer Tools such as [Firefox DevTools](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/devtools-user/index.html), [Safari Web Inspector](https://webkit.org/web-inspector/), and [Edge DevTools](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-edge/devtools-guide-chromium/landing/), I am most familiar & comfortable with the layout of Chrome.
- **Internet Connection:** Aim to have at least 2-3 Mbps or more to speed up development, especially if you'll be downloading large files or loading video/image based resources. Most libraries and a variety of public places can have high-speed Wi-Fi available for visitors free-of-charge.

Based on the fact that you're reading this right now, you probably already have a browser & internet connection!

[Windows](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows), [macOS](https://www.apple.com/macos/), and most [Linux distributions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_distribution) should include a text editor by default, which in this case should be more than enough to view and edit HTML, CSS & JavaScript files.

For those using mobile devices, I advise switching to a laptop or desktop for a more streamlined experience. While mobile development is feasible on Android or iOS, the ease of a full-sized computer, keyboard, and mouse is unmatched. Visual Studio Code is accessible via most browsers on any device, however, you would still need to serve/host it from another machine. For optimal functionality, a personal computer remains the best choice.

<summary><h4>System Requirements 🖥️</h4></summary>

System requirements for these projects can vary due to the fact that they use different amounts of client-side processing power and resources. In general, a recent operating system like [Windows](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows), [macOS](https://www.apple.com/macos/), or a popular [Linux distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_distribution) usually suffices. Modern computers, especially those purchased in the last few years, should meet these needs adequately.

Performance will heavily rely on your specific hardware setup, including processor speed, RAM capacity, storage type, and graphics card quality. The operating system choice and its configuration also play a significant role in speed.

To give you a practical example, I personally used a [Lenovo Thinkpad T480](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0842X4BNF) for the entirety of my recent projects. This laptop, has been great for a variety of daily tasks, including programming.

The computer I used for the entire project features the following specifications:

- **Operating System:** [Kubuntu Linux 22.04](https://cdimage.ubuntu.com/kubuntu/releases/22.04/release/)
- **Processor:** 8th Gen Intel Core Duo i5-8350U
- **RAM:** 16GB DDR4 RAM
- **Storage:** 512GB SSD of data
- **Graphics:** Intel UHD Graphics 620
- **Display:** 14.0" Screen with FHD 1920x1080 resolution.

This configuration was more than sufficient for both my project and other tasks. Interestingly, working on a less powerful laptop has its advantages, such as highlighting inefficient code that consumes excessive resources.

If you're unsure, I recommend testing your setup with the intended software. Should you encounter any errors, feel free to reach out for assistance. Your feedback can also help in making projects more adaptable to diverse hardware, operating systems, and browsers.
